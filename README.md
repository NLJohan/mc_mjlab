Training and playing use mjlab's own `train`/`play` scripts — see
[Training and playing](#training-and-playing).

## Setup

### Native controller interface

`src/mc_rtc_interface` builds itself — there is no manual cmake step. The build
backend is scikit-build-core, so `uv sync` configures and builds it into
`build/`, and `editable.rebuild` means any later `uv run` rebuilds and
reinstalls it on import when a source file has changed. The actions own a native
`ControllersManager` and two shared-memory blocks; `controller_timeout_ms`
defaults to 60000. `console_output` selects no rows, environment zero
(`single`), or every row (`all`).

The extension and its worker load out of `build/install/platlib`, which the
editable install points at — they are not copied into `.venv`. That persistent
`build/` is also what makes the native tests runnable directly:

```sh
cd build && ctest            # C++ tests plus the pytest suite in tests/
```

Configuring by hand is only for building against a prefix other than this
project's: `cmake -S src/mc_rtc_interface -B <dir>` then
`cmake --install <dir> --prefix <prefix>`, which otherwise defaults to the
selected interpreter's environment.

### Controller datastore

An action can read extra numbers out of mc_rtc through its datastore, on top of
the joint channels every task uses. This is **optional and opt-in**: a task asks
for entries by listing aliases in `datastore_vectors_outputs` / `datastore_scalar_outputs`,
both empty by default — the zero-residual demo lists nothing and runs with the
datastore untouched. A task names known entries in those lists; a getter that
does not exist yet is added to `instance_datastore_plugin`.

**Some basic entries are already implemented.** `instance_datastore_plugin`
ships four getters compiled into the native interface, so a task can ask for
them with nothing to install and no controller to patch:

| Entry                       | Type       | Value                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `mc_mjlab::planned_zmp`     | `Vector3d` | control-centroid ZMP of the QP's own solution |
| `mc_mjlab::control_com`     | `Vector3d` | CoM of the robot the QP integrates            |
| `mc_mjlab::control_com_vel` | `Vector3d` | that robot's CoM velocity                     |
| `mc_mjlab::support_foot`    | `double`   | right=0, left=1                               |

That is what residual-balance runs on: it requests `planned_zmp`, `control_com`
and `control_com_vel`, all served by the plugin. ResidualMPC goes further and
also asks for `ismpc_walking::t`, `get_ts_target` and `qp_objective`, which only
that controller can answer.

Which side serves an alias is decided by one rule: **a name beginning
`mc_mjlab::` comes from the plugin; any other name must already exist on the
controller.** `controller_vector_callbacks` / `controller_scalar_callbacks` map
public aliases onto callback names, so the same alias can be repointed at either
side — `support_foot` resolves to the plugin's getter, while `walking_ref_vel`
resolves to the controller's `ismpc_walking::get_ref_vel`. The defaults are
`VECTOR_CALLBACKS` and `SCALAR_CALLBACKS` in `bridge/controller_datastore.py`.

Adding a getter means adding a function to `instance_datastore_plugin` and
naming it in that map; `ControllerInstance::finish_reset` then registers it on
every controller build, which is what makes it survive the rebuild
`MCGlobalController::reset()` performs at each episode reset. The getters read
`MCController::robot()`, the robot the QP integrates — not the canonical output
robot, whose `comVelocity`/`comAcceleration` read exactly zero.

Nothing fails quietly. A `mc_mjlab::` name matching no plugin function, a
`mc_mjlab::` name the controller already defines, or any requested non-prefixed
callback the controller lacks is an error at controller init, not a silent zero.

> [!CAUTION] `planned_zmp` must keep its control-centroid definition.
> Checkpoints were trained against it, and ISMPC's delay-compensated reachable
> `zmp_target` is a different quantity. Never substitute it, and never let the
> callback return zero.

Writing _back_ through the datastore additionally needs native per-callback
usage flags; commands fail loudly when the usage-offset methods or the
configured callbacks are absent. See
[the numeric interface and unsupported callback inventory](docs/coupling.md#DatastoreCommands),
and [instance_datastore_plugin](docs/coupling.md#instance_datastore_plugin) for
the live measurements behind each getter.

To check the adapter end to end, run `cd build && ctest` for the native tests
and deterministic contracts, then the live walking checks
(`uv run python scripts/verify_native_action_live.py --mode position`, then
`--mode torque`). A zero-residual demo exercises neither the adapter nor worker
recovery, so it is not a substitute. Checkpoint contract validation remains
enforced either way.

### mjlab dependency

`pyproject.toml` declares a plain `mjlab` dependency and deliberately does not
choose where it comes from. Pick one before the first sync:

- **PyPI release**: nothing to add.

- **Local checkout**: develop against a local mjlab instead of a release. Add to
  `pyproject.toml`, but do not commit it:

  ```toml
  [tool.uv.sources]
  mjlab = { path = "<path/to/mjlab>", editable = true }
  ```

- **Git**: track upstream without a local checkout:

  ```toml
  [tool.uv.sources]
  mjlab = { git = "https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab" }
  ```

then run:

```sh
uv sync
```

The ROS workspace's own dependencies are Debian packages under
`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages`, which a plain venv hides. If that bites — a
bare `pytest` aborts importing `launch_testing` — create the venv with them
(a `uv venv` flag only; uv has no setting for it):

```sh
uv venv --system-site-packages && uv sync
```

or flip the option in `.venv/pyvenv.cfg`.

### mc_rtc dependency

Refer to the superbuild tutorial

> [!CAUTION] The mc_rtc Python bindings and controller libraries come from the
> sourced workspace (`PYTHONPATH`/`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`); run from a shell that has
> it sourced. The workspace's bindings must be built for the same interpreter as
> this package's venv (`requires-python` pins it): a version mismatch fails at
> import, or worse, segfaults.

### ROS plugin: keep autoload disabled

mc_rtc autoloads its ROS plugin into every process that constructs an
`MCGlobalController` — here, every controller worker. The plugin's background
threads (an rclcpp node plus DDS discovery) corrupt the process heap: in a
controlled test, 15/15 short-lived controller processes crashed at teardown with
the plugin loaded (SIGSEGV, or `munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer` after resets)
and 0/15 without it, matching a week of kernel-log segfaults across python3 and
mc_mujoco. With dozens of workers this surfaced as workers dying or wedging
mid-training.

Autoload is disabled machine-side by removing the marker directory:

```sh
cd ~/workspace/install/lib/mc_plugins && mv autoload autoload.old
```

A workspace rebuild/reinstall can recreate it — if controller workers start
dying again, check this first. The plugins a controller itself requests (e.g.
`footsteps_planner_plugin` for LogisticController_ismpc) still load on demand;
only the unconditional autoload is affected.

## Running the demo

The demo runs the controller specified in `etc/mc_rtc.yaml` with the RL residual
left at zero, so the robot tracks raw mc_rtc output — a healthy run holds a
steady root height. It is a registered task (`Mc-Mjlab-Zero-Residual-*`) driven
by mjlab's `play --agent zero`; the script only resolves the id and opens the
viewer.

```sh
scripts/demos/run_test_mc_rtc.sh                    # viser viewer, 1 env
scripts/demos/run_test_mc_rtc.sh --num-envs 8       # extra args go to `play`
scripts/demos/run_test_mc_rtc.sh --viewer native    # native viewer instead
MC_MJLAB_CONTROL=torque scripts/demos/run_test_mc_rtc.sh   # torque control mode
```

> [!NOTE] `Mc-Mjlab-Zero-Residual-*` is a play task; `train` on it is not
> supported. It has no reward to optimise, and it is built for a zero action — a
> policy sampling every 2 ms with nothing to terminate a wrecked robot overruns
> the contact budget and faults in the physics. Train the balance task instead.

## Training and playing

Use existing `train` and `play` scripts:

A task id is `Mc-Mjlab-<task dir>-<Enabled>-<MainRobot>-<control suffix>`, the
controller and robot read from `etc/mc_rtc.yaml`, so editing that file changes
the ids — which is the point, since it also changes what a checkpoint is valid
against. It is title-cased with `_` turned into `-`, so it is not the yaml's
spelling: `LogisticController_ismpc` on `HRP5P` reads
`Logisticcontroller-Ismpc-Hrp5P`. Use `list-envs` rather than assembling one;
these are for the config as committed (`MainRobot: HRP5P`,
`Enabled: LogisticController_ismpc`):

```sh
uv run list-envs   # this repo's ids, plus mjlab's
uv run train Mc-Mjlab-Residual-Balance-Logisticcontroller-Ismpc-Hrp5P-Position
uv run play  Mc-Mjlab-Residual-Balance-Logisticcontroller-Ismpc-Hrp5P-Position \
  --checkpoint-file <path/to/model_*.pt>
```

The mc_mjlab surface is ten tasks, and `uv run list-envs` shows all of them.
One, the achievement-gated ankle curriculum, advances only from held-out
qualification reports — see
[docs/difficulty.md](docs/difficulty.md#achievement_finite_impulse_curriculum)
for how to drive it.

Ten completed ablations used to register behind an environment variable, for
replaying their checkpoints under their original ids. They are gone, along with
the task dials and the gated walking-reference code that existed only for them.
Reproducing one of those experiments means checking out the revision before that
cleanup; every supported checkpoint still loads on the ten ids above.

Every residual-balance training run publishes a PID-bound heartbeat under
`<run>/watchdog/`. For an unattended run, attach the cooperative monitor from a
second tmux window:

```sh
run_dir=/absolute/path/to/the/run
trainer_pid=$(jq -r .pid "$run_dir/watchdog/runtime.json")
uv run python scripts/watch_training.py \
  --pid "$trainer_pid" --run-dir "$run_dir" --max-level stop
```

It warns on stale progress, low GPU memory, controller-worker failures, and
optional qualification regressions. A stop is honored only at an iteration
boundary and only after a recoverable checkpoint has been acknowledged. See
[docs/training-watchdog.md](docs/training-watchdog.md) for thresholds and
artifacts.

### Did it beat the controller?

Not something the training curves can say: `Episode_Reward/*` is an episode sum,
and those correlate with episode length at r = +0.98.

```sh
# Score a checkpoint against the zero-residual controller, deterministically.
uv run python scripts/compare_to_baseline.py --checkpoint <path/to/model_*.pt>
# Inspect every raw reward, its live weight, rate, activity, and distribution.
uv run python scripts/audit_rewards.py --checkpoint <path/to/model_*.pt>
# Can a constant residual move the centre of pressure at all?
uv run python scripts/probe_residual_authority.py --level 1.0
uv run python scripts/inspect_controller_datastore.py
# Does the DCM objective still prefer standing to walking? (no checkpoint needed)
uv run python scripts/validate_dcm_objective.py
```

`compare_to_baseline.py` steps both arms in one run and takes a fixed number of
episodes per env: counting everything that finished inside a time budget
oversamples short episodes and inflates the failure rate. `--num-workers`
defaults low on both, to leave room for a training job.

### Environment variables

| Variable                  | Effect                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MC_MJLAB_CONTROL`        | `position` (default) or `torque`, for the demo                         |
| `MC_MJLAB_PRINT_RESIDUAL` | Steps between `[residual]` printouts during `play`; `0` silences       |
| `MC_MJLAB_PUSH_DEBUG`     | Positive float: scale pushes, cap warm-up at 1 s, print `[push]` lines |

### External paths

These symlink outside this repo (into the mc_rtc workspace) and must exist for
the demo to actually step controllers:

- `src/mc_mjlab/robots/<ROBOT>/` — the MJCF, meshes, and PD gains are symlinked
  on first use from `$HOME/workspace/install/share/mc_mujoco/<ROBOT>` if they
  are found
