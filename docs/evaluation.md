# Evaluation

How to find out whether a residual policy actually beat mc_rtc, and the sampling
traps that make it easy to get a confident wrong answer. Scripts in `scripts/`.

## Who owns what

`scripts/` is not part of the wheel — `[tool.scikit-build.wheel] packages` ships
`src/mc_mjlab` only — so a script may import the library and the library may
never import a script. The machinery the scripts share lives in
`scripts/evaluation/`, a package rather than a pile of cross-script imports:

| Module | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `rollout` | environment construction and teardown, reset without updating the observation history, pre-reset episode-buffer snapshots |
| `comparison` | `compare_to_baseline.py`'s paired records and stopping rule |
| `qualification` | `qualify_checkpoints.py`'s fixed-episode schedules and decisions |
| `qualification_strata` | per-stratum accounting, formerly shipped inside the task package |
| `reward_audit` | the live reward audit, formerly shipped inside the task package |
| `disturbances`, `scenarios` | the shared scenario definitions both samplers draw from |

Comparison and qualification share `rollout` and nothing else. They are
different experimental designs — different sampling, statistics and episode
records — and merging their record types would make one of them silently wrong.

**Retired 2026-09-16:** `verify_improvement_contracts.py` (migrated into
`tests/`, see below), `run_curriculum_diagnostics.py`, `probe_step_duration.py`
and `probe_walking_reference.py` (their subjects were removed), plus the
evaluator options that drove them. Each has a `Retired:` section in the doc that
covered it, keeping the measurements verbatim.

## Why the training curves cannot answer it

`Episode_Reward/*` comes from a *stochastic* policy still carrying its
exploration noise, which on this task is a disturbance in its own right — it goes
through the real PD gains onto the joints doing the balancing. The sums also
correlate with episode length at r = +0.98, so they move when the robot survives
longer rather than when it tracks better.

## audit_rewards.py

Run the reward audit before changing an objective or spending a training run:

```sh
uv run python scripts/audit_rewards.py
uv run python scripts/audit_rewards.py --checkpoint logs/.../model_180.pt
```

It reports each term before weighting, its effective live weight, weighted
per-second rate, integrated window contribution, nonzero fraction, quantiles,
and exact output shape. A checkpoint run splits environments between policy zero
and the trained actor. This catches an inert or mis-scaled objective; it does not
replace `compare_to_baseline.py`, because reward samples are not fixed-episode
qualification outcomes and the two arms do not occupy identical states.

The JSON report embeds the effective reward contract and records
`zmp_grounded` and `recovery_active` beside conditional rewards. Read the full
unit and zero-weight-call semantics in
[reward-shaping.md](reward-shaping.md#reward_audit).

## compare_to_baseline.py

### --task

**`--task <id>` scores any registered task.** Without it the script builds a
residual-balance cfg from its own flags, which is how every measurement before
2026-08-28 was taken and is still the flexible path for that task. With it, the
environment, PPO config and runner come from the task registry, so a checkpoint
from any registered task can be scored against its own zero-action arm. A task
that registers no `runner_cls` falls back to `MjlabOnPolicyRunner`.

```sh
uv run python scripts/compare_to_baseline.py --checkpoint <model.pt> \
  --task Mc-Mjlab-Residual-Mpc-Logisticcontroller-Ismpc-Hrp5P-Joint-Torque
```

The report needed no per-task work: it reads reward and termination terms from
the live managers rather than a fixed list, so it names whatever the task
defines. `--recovery-dcm-std` is the one residual-balance-specific flag left, and
it now errors rather than raising `KeyError` on a task without that reward.

**What it does not give you** is a promotion verdict. `qualify_checkpoints.py` is
still residual-balance only, and its gates — recovery DCM, ZMP, the hazard ratio
— are that task's objective. Deciding what promotion means for a
velocity-tracking task is a separate question from being able to measure it.

### Original



Both arms run in the same env, with the same pushes, terminations and reward
terms, and the policy is evaluated deterministically (`MLPModel.forward` returns
the distribution mean), so a deficit is the learned mean being worse rather than
the dither.

```sh
uv run python scripts/compare_to_baseline.py --checkpoint logs/.../model_499.pt
```

Checkpoints from the `Position-Velocity` task need its additional action and
observation layout reconstructed explicitly:

```sh
uv run python scripts/compare_to_baseline.py \
  --checkpoint logs/.../model_187.pt --walking-reference
```

Reward-shape screens must be scored with their own width. Pass
`--recovery-dcm-std` when it differs from the repository default; this changes
only the reported recovery term, not the policy or simulated behavior.

Two things it does that a naive A/B does not, both learned by getting them wrong
first.

### Both arms at once

The envs are split in half and stepped together in one loop, so the two arms
share the wall-clock window, the machine load and the worker pool. Running one
arm and then the other would put the second on controllers already worn by the
first, and would let anything that drifts during the run land on only one of them.

The cost is that the pairing is no longer within-env: an env belongs to one arm
for the whole run, so `encoder_bias` (a per-env startup constant that moves
survival on its own) differs between the arms rather than cancelling. With envs
split evenly that is a wash in expectation, and the run is half as long.

### Fixed episodes per env, not "everything that finished"

A fall recycles in a few seconds while a survivor runs to the cap, so counting
every episode completed inside a wall-clock budget samples them proportional to
1/duration. **That inflates a failure rate badly — a true 10% can read 67% — and
it inflates it by a different factor for each arm**, which biases the very
difference being measured.

Taking the first K episodes of every env is unbiased because the selection never
looks at how long an episode lasted. The raw counts are printed alongside so the
size of that correction stays visible.

K is counted over **every env the arm owns**, not over the envs that appear in
the results. Seeding it from completed episodes instead silently drops any env
still inside its first episode at the deadline — which is to say the survivors.
That is a selection on duration again, the exact bias this exists to avoid. An
arm with such an env reports K=0 and says so rather than producing a
clean-looking number computed off the fallers alone.

### Resetting without corrupting the observation history

`ManagerBasedRlEnv.reset()` ends with
`observation_manager.compute(update_history=True)`, and `compute_group` appends
to every term's `CircularBuffer` for *all* envs, not just `env_ids` — the
buffer's write pointer is shared across the batch, so it cannot be otherwise.
`step()` has already appended this step's frame, so calling `reset()` in the loop
gives every `history_length=5` term two frames on any step where at least one env
finished, which is most of them. The window then spans half the time it should
and carries near-duplicate frames.

That is not symmetric across the arms: the baseline applies a zero action and
reads no observations at all, so the distortion lands only on the policy — it
biases the difference the script exists to measure. Hence `_reset_done`, which
makes the three calls `step()`'s own `auto_reset` path makes, minus the recompute.

The residual cost, stated rather than hidden: `get_observations()` returns the
cached buffer, so the first action of a new episode is computed from the dead
episode's last observation. One step per episode, against every step of every
episode the other way. From the next step on the histories are exactly what
training produces — the reset zeroed those rows, so the next append backfills all
five slots with the fresh frame.

### Per-step rates beat survival

**Divide episode length out and read that first.** Survival to the cap is the
headline number but it is a badly underpowered one: at ~20% it needs roughly
n = 150 per arm to resolve a 5pp difference. The per-step tracking rates resolved
a 10% deficit at n = 50 with p < 0.001, on the same data where survival came back
p = 0.70.

Measured the hard way on 2026-08-14. Three comparisons of the same training run:

| checkpoint | n/arm | survival verdict | per-step verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model_1499` (previous run) | 48 | -2.1pp, p = 0.80 | not computed |
| `model_1050` | 18/24 | +0.0pp, p = 1.00 | not computed |
| `model_3050` | 48/54 | +3.2pp, p = 0.70 | **-10%, p < 0.001** |

The first two said "no detectable difference" and were read as parity. The third,
with barely more data, showed the policy was significantly *worse* all along —
the survival statistic simply could not see it. An underpowered null is not
evidence of equivalence, and this task's survival rate is underpowered at any
sample size a 20-minute run can reach.

The episode-sum rewards do not substitute: they correlate with episode length at
r = +0.98, so a policy with shorter episodes shows lower sums whether or not it
tracks worse. Only the length-normalised rate separates the two.

### Reading the output

`auto_reset = False` is essential: `step()` otherwise resets terminated envs *in
place* before returning, zeroing both `episode_length_buf` and the reward
manager's `_episode_sums`, so the episode being measured is erased before the
caller sees `terminated`.

Reward sums correlate strongly with episode length on this task, so a reward
delta that tracks the length delta is not independent evidence.

Quartiles are reported because the mean alone hides the shape: episode length is
strongly bimodal (an early fall against a full survival), so a mean that moves
can mean either "falls got later" or "more episodes reached the cap". `sem` is
what two runs have to differ by to mean anything. Quartiles use the "inclusive"
linear-interpolation convention numpy/pandas use, so they match anything the data
gets pasted into.

`--drop-obs` exists for checkpoints that predate an observation term: the actor's
first layer and its `obs_normalizer` are both sized by the concatenated width, so
adding a term retires every earlier checkpoint with a `size mismatch` at load.
Removing one from the *middle* of a group would silently shift later terms into
the wrong column rather than fail, so it is only sound for terms appended at the
end.

## Never score the last checkpoint

**Score the best-metric checkpoint, and confirm the choice with a second read.**
The last checkpoint is not the best one and can be actively broken: `zeroinit-4ev`
peaked on `Episode_Metrics/zmp_error` at iteration 1320, decayed for 1600
iterations, and then diverged outright in its last 50, so `model_2999` was corrupt
while `model_1000` was the best result this project has produced. Reading only the
final checkpoint would have reported the opposite of the truth in both directions.

The cheap procedure: smooth `Episode_Metrics/zmp_error` over ~60 iterations, take
the argmin, and compare that checkpoint plus one much later. Two reads bracket the
trajectory — a single one cannot distinguish "still improving" from "peaked and
decaying", and those call for opposite decisions about run length.

## qualify_checkpoints.py

The promotion path scores **every saved validation checkpoint**, supplied as
individual paths, a run directory, or globs. It writes raw paired episodes to
`qualification.csv` and configuration, clustered statistics, Holm-adjusted
p-values, gate failures, and the selected checkpoint to `qualification.json`.

```sh
uv run python scripts/qualify_checkpoints.py logs/.../run_dir \
  --seed 42 --seed 43 --seed 44 --out-dir logs/qualification/run_name
```

The default scenarios are nominal walking, the historical velocity kick, a
force-based finite impulse, and a held-out robust impulse with stage-one
friction/gain/strength and delay perturbations. Episode counts are fixed per env
and arm; wall time never decides which episodes enter the result. The robust
scenario is invalid for promotion if more than 5% of its baseline episodes fail
before the first disturbance.

### qualification_strata.csv

The qualifier also writes `qualification_strata.csv` and
`qualification_joints.csv`. They are additional diagnostics; the established
promotion gates still read the original episode aggregates.

Every episode step belongs to exactly one stratum:

- `startup/none` covers episode age through 10 s before a disturbance.
- `recovery/{forward,backward,left,right}` covers the live `recovery_dcm`
  window after a recorded push. Recovery takes precedence on the first pushed
  step, so that step cannot leak into startup or sustained exposure.
- `sustained/none` is every remaining step, including nominal walking after the
  startup transient and the intervals between recovery windows.

Directions use the push velocity in the controller base frame. The largest
absolute horizontal component selects sagittal versus lateral; its sign selects
forward/backward or left/right. The raw rows remain one episode, environment,
pair, arm, and stratum each. JSON differences are paired on those episode keys
and then clustered by environment, or by seed when multiple seeds are present.
Timesteps are never treated as independent samples.

The stratum CSV reports grounded fraction, grounded-conditional DCM and ZMP
errors, controller-command CoM-velocity error, foot slip, recovery gate duty,
detector score, and actuator-demand ratio. A stratum that contains the final
step also carries its exact termination cause; the other strata in that episode
carry zero, which attributes rather than duplicates failures.

The joint CSV reports each residual joint's physical authority scale, requested
and executed normalized RMS, executed physical RMS, active fraction,
near-policy-bound fraction, feasibility-projection fraction, and actuator effort
ratio. Physical RMS and authority are radians in position mode and newton-metres
in torque mode. Per-joint effort is sampled at policy-step endpoints; the scalar
`max_effort_ratio` has substep coverage and remains the hard safety gate.

Read a zero `active_fraction` together with gate duty: it means the joint
delivered no residual, while a nonzero request with a zero gate means the actor
asked but recovery authority correctly withheld it. `com_velocity_error` is the
controller-command tracking diagnostic: lower means realized CoM motion stayed
closer to what mc_rtc commanded in that regime.

Use the zero-residual component gate before adding or widening a robustness
term:

```sh
uv run python scripts/calibrate_robustness_profile.py
```

It runs each component and their combination through the 12-second gait
transition, reports survival and worker failures, and exits nonzero below 95%
survival.

Each env runs a crossover: baseline and policy alternate, with starting arm
balanced across env ids. Disturbance timing, planar direction, equivalent delta
velocity, duration, and application height are deterministic functions of seed,
scenario, env, pair, and occurrence. Both arms of a pair therefore see the same
schedule and the same controller instance and startup encoder bias. Statistics
cluster pairs within env; with multiple evaluation seeds they aggregate envs
within seed and place the confidence interval across seeds.

Safety and nominal gates run before ranking. Passing checkpoints are ranked
lexicographically by recovery, hazard, then residual use. The test set is not an
input to this command: run it only after `selected` is fixed, and only for that
checkpoint.

`scripts/generate_clean_checkpoint.py` creates a provenance-bearing untrained
checkpoint in the current policy format for smoke tests. It does not translate
old Gaussian checkpoints. Those remain valid only in a worktree containing their
original actor, observation layout, and controller inputs; generating new
validation checkpoints from the current tree is the clean migration path.

## source_drift

**Current:** defining-file digests live in the manifest's audit `record` and in
neither enforced contract. `validate_effective_training_manifest` strips
`source_sha256` from both the training contract and the policy interface, then
re-digests both sides rather than comparing the stored digest, and prints the
drifted audit paths when the contract still matches.

**Why.** On 2026-08-27 a stage-0 re-qualification of a checkpoint trained the
same afternoon died with
`Checkpoint policy interface differs from the active run:
observations.groups.actor.terms.controller_ref_pos.callable.source_sha256, ...`.
Nothing about the actor's interface had changed. Unrelated additions to
`tasks/mdp.py` — a new metric and a new event class — changed the digest of the
file that happens to define six observation terms, and that stranded the
checkpoint. Source identity is evidence about semantics; it is not semantics, and
making it the enforced contract means any edit to a shared module retires every
checkpoint that module touches.

The enforced contract still catches what matters: a renamed or relocated
callable changes its qualified name, and term ordering, dimensions, group
settings and effective parameters are all still compared.

**Re-digesting both sides is also a strengthening.** Validation previously
compared the `*_sha256` fields stored in the checkpoint. Those are derived
values, so a stale or forged digest could mask a real difference or invent one.
The payload now decides.

**A field added after a checkpoint was written is not an interface change.**
On 2026-08-28 the action term gained its datastore scalar outputs (then named
`controller_scalars`), and every checkpoint
trained before it became unqualifiable: the saved manifest cannot contain a key
that did not exist. `validate_effective_training_manifest` now drops keys the
active contract *gained* before comparing, and names them. Removed keys and
changed values still fail, and observation ordering, dimensions and effective
parameters are compared separately, so an addition that really does move the
actor interface still shows up there.

**Re-measure if:** the manifest schema changes or a new field is added that
should be enforced rather than recorded.

**History:**
- 2026-08-27 — moved source hashes to audit-only after they stranded a
  same-day checkpoint; the branch review had flagged this as the most dangerous
  defect on the branch and `leo-mjlab-review.md` had already recorded the
  decision to exclude them.

## _RENAMED_MODULES

**Current:** `validate_effective_training_manifest` rewrites the import paths a
saved manifest recorded before the 2026-09-15 source-tree move, so a checkpoint
is compared against the module spellings it would carry today. `_RENAMED_MODULES`
maps the whole-module moves; terms from the split `mc_mjlab.tasks.mdp` are
resolved by scanning the seven `mc_mjlab.mdp` submodules for the one that
defines the name, so the map does not have to list every term and cannot go
stale against a later re-split.

**Why.** Both enforced contracts name each manager term, action class, config
dataclass and configured `class_name` by `module:qualname`. The move changed
every one of those strings while changing no behaviour, so without the rewrite
each of the position, ankle, achievement and matched-impulse checkpoints would
fail its full resume *and* its actor-only load with a diff listing nothing but
paths. That is the failure `source_drift` already records as the wrong
shape of enforcement: identity is evidence about semantics, not semantics.

The rewrite is deliberately narrow. It is applied only to the saved side, only
to the listed modules, and it does not touch values, orderings, dimensions or
effective parameters: a term that really did move to a different callable still
fails, because its attribute name no longer resolves.

**Re-measure if:** modules move again -- add the pair rather than widening the
rule -- or `mc_mjlab.mdp` stops binding its seven submodules, which is what the
lookup walks.

**History:**
- 2026-09-15 — added with the source-layout refactor
  (`docs/target-source-tree.md`), which moved 20 modules and split the MDP terms
  into seven. Verified path-only: the moved files' contents are unchanged in the
  move commits.

## invalidated_scenarios

**Current:** a scenario whose baseline or policy arm lost a controller worker is
removed from every substantive gate, not just flagged. `promotion()` reports the
invalidation, replaces the recovery-DCM verdict with
`recovery DCM unreadable, scenario invalidated`, computes the hazard ratio over
the surviving scenarios and says how many those were, and records the excluded
names under `invalidated_scenarios`.

This cannot promote anything: an invalidation already appends its own reason, so
`eligible` is `False` before any of this runs. The change is entirely about what
the report *claims*.

**Why.** The 2026-08-27 `model_140` verdict read
`finite_impulse: controller worker failure invalidated the run` and
`finite impulse: recovery DCM improvement is below 5%` side by side. The second
is computed from the first's discarded episodes. Read quickly it says the policy
failed the recovery gate, when the truth is that the run has no recovery
measurement at all — the same confusion between a measurement verdict and a
policy verdict that `clusters_for_confidence` above exists to prevent.

**The failures are wedges, not crashes.** All three in that run reported
`exit code None`, which is the pool's timeout killing an unresponsive worker
rather than a signal. That is the documented mc_rtc mode: a controller whose MPC
has collapsed can hang permanently inside `reset()`. Harder impulse bands reach
that state more often, so a qualification run over the matched distribution is
more exposed to it than one over `[0.10, 0.25]`. Two of four scenarios were lost
at 16 environments and 6 workers.

**Re-measure if:** the pool timeout, worker count, or impulse distribution
changes.

**History:**
- 2026-08-27 — separated invalidation from verdict after a worker wedge produced
  a recovery-gate reason on a scenario that had no valid episodes.

## clusters_for_confidence

**`--num-envs` defaults to 16, not 8.** The paired interval has
`seeds x environments` clusters, so the old 8-environment single-seed default
gave 8 — a third of the 23 that the best measured recovery effect needs. Sixteen
is also the documented ceiling for running beside a training job.


**Current:** the paired interval is a Student-t interval over
`(seed, environment)` clusters, and every summary carries its `clusters` count.
When the recovery-DCM improvement clears its 5% magnitude bar but its interval
still touches zero, `promotion()` names the cluster count that would resolve it
instead of reporting an undifferentiated gate failure.

**Two defects this replaced.** A single cluster produced `sem = NaN`, so
`ci_high >= 0.0` evaluated False and the confidence half of the recovery gate
silently passed; the standard error is now infinite, which fails closed. And the
paired statistic collapsed to seed means whenever more than one seed ran, so the
achievement mode's mandatory two seeds turned 32 environment clusters into 2 —
where a 95% normal interval has roughly 24% coverage, because the correct
critical value at one degree of freedom is `12.71`, not `1.96`.

**It did not promote anything retroactively.** Re-scored with the t interval,
all three checkpoints that the 2026-08-25 paired qualification rejected still
fail, and by wider margins:

| checkpoint | mean, m | relative | normal `ci_high` | t `ci_high` | clusters needed |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| standard 180 | -0.01010 | -7.70% | +0.00119 | +0.00218 | 23 |
| ankle 187 | -0.00675 | -5.08% | +0.00380 | +0.00472 | 42 |
| ankle 140 | -0.00639 | -4.79% | +0.00752 | +0.00874 | 79 |

At one seed the change is strictly stricter: 16 clusters move from `1.96` to
`t(15) = 2.13`, an 8.7% wider interval. Those runs used 16 environments, so the
best of them was **seven clusters short** of resolving its own effect. That is a
sampling verdict, not a policy verdict, and the old report could not tell them
apart.

**Re-measure if:** the recovery-DCM effect size, per-environment variance,
episode pairing, or the 5% magnitude bar changes.

**History:**
- 2026-08-27 — replaced the normal interval and seed-mean collapse after the
  branch review found three rejections whose reported cause was confidence.

## run_improvement_screens.py

**Current:** the resumable launcher contains only the supported standard and
ankle tasks. It retains the 188-iteration, seed-42, 128-environment, 30-worker
comparison budget and TensorBoard logging. Completion state and one console log
per arm live under `logs/critique_screens/`.

Launch it inside tmux:

```sh
uv run python scripts/run_improvement_screens.py
```

Qualification accepts `--authority-set`, `--controller-history`,
`--proprio-history`, and `--recurrent` to reconstruct archived actor shapes.
`compare_to_baseline.py --walking-reference` reconstructs the velocity variant.
Historical variants therefore remain evaluable without keeping their task ids in
the default registry.

**Re-measure if:** screen budget, worker capacity, task registrations, or PPO
screen axes change.

**History:**
- 2026-08-27 — removed the eleven failed/non-policy arms after the original
  matrix completed; the launcher now compares only standard and ankle authority.
- 2026-08-24 — added after implementing the critique changes so interrupted
  multi-hour screens resume at arm boundaries instead of silently duplicating
  completed runs.

## Comparing a checkpoint whose config has moved on

Checkpoints die whenever the observation width changes, so scoring an older one
means reconstructing the cfg it trained under. A `git worktree` at the right commit
plus `PYTHONPATH=<worktree>/src:$PYTHONPATH` shadows the installed package without
touching the working tree or any live run. Two things bite:

New residual-balance checkpoints embed their complete base-controller provenance
under `infos/base_controller_provenance`: the project and user mc_rtc YAML, the
installed selected-controller YAML, and the PD gains, each with its source and
SHA-256 digest. Readable copies also live under the run's
`base_controller_config/`. Loading refuses a mismatch, because evaluating the
same residual against a changed base is a different policy. The manual procedure
below remains necessary for checkpoints created before this runner existed.

- **Prepend to `PYTHONPATH`, never replace it.** The mc_rtc bindings arrive on it
  from the sourced workspace; clobbering it fails at `import mc_rbdyn`.
- **Copy the live `etc/mc_rtc.yaml` into the worktree.** It is tracked, so the
  worktree gets that commit's `MainRobot`, not the one you are running; a
  different robot means a different joint count and a `size mismatch` that looks
  exactly like a stale-checkpoint error.

## validate_dcm_objective.py

The gate the DCM objective has to pass **before** a training run, not after:
does the reward score a walking robot and a standing one alike, and does a push
still collapse it? No checkpoint is involved — every arm runs a zero residual.

```sh
uv run python scripts/validate_dcm_objective.py                     # ~1 min/regime
uv run python scripts/validate_dcm_objective.py --residual-level 0  # skip arm 3
```

Three arms, identical but for the controller and the residual:

| arm | config | residual |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `walking` | `etc/mc_rtc.yaml` as it stands | zero |
| `standing` | the same, with `Enabled: Posture` written to a temp copy | zero |
| `walking+residual` | as `walking` | full-scale, alternating signs |

Nothing in the repo is touched to get the standing arm: `posture_config` rewrites
the one `Enabled:` line into `--out-dir`, and `make_residual_balance_env_cfg(mc_rtc_yaml=...)`
takes it from there.

What each block of the output answers:

- **the quantile table** — the nominal error distribution, which is what sizes
  `DCM_STD`; the printed `std = q / sqrt(-log s)` line inverts the kernel for a
  target score `s` at quantile `q`.
- **corrected against legacy** — the same samples scored with and without the
  commanded offset, so the correction's effect is visible rather than assumed.
- **standing edge over walking** — the defect the correction exists for. Read it
  at the `DCM_STD` actually configured, not at the friendliest column.
- **error by speed deficit** — the decisive one. It bins the *walking* arm by
  `measured - commanded` CoM speed: a term that pays a robot for resisting its
  own gait shows its lowest error in the "slower than commanded" band.
- **error by time since a push** — the disturbance response, and the profile that
  sizes `RECOVERY_WINDOW_S`.
- **residual authority over the target** — the residual must not be able to earn
  reward by moving the *reference* instead of the state.

## probe_residual_authority.py

Answers a different question, and the one to ask first when a reward looks blind:
**can the action reach the objective at all?**

The residual_balance reward proved to be blind to the policy — with episode
length divided out, the per-step `zmp_tracking` rate is the same for a zero
residual and for every trained checkpoint (0.01183 / 0.01187 / 0.01196, SE
0.00015). Two things can cause that: the reward is badly shaped, or the action
cannot move the objective. This settles the second before anyone spends time on
the first, because at `residual_scale = 0.01` rad (~0.57 degrees of joint offset)
it is entirely possible the residual simply cannot shift the centre of pressure.

The probe drives a **constant** residual instead of a policy and measures
`mdp.zmp_error` — the distance in metres between the measured centre of pressure
and the one mc_rtc planned. A constant offset is the bluntest possible input: if
a full-scale one does not move that distance, nothing a policy does will either.

```sh
uv run python scripts/probe_residual_authority.py --level 0    --minutes 10
uv run python scripts/probe_residual_authority.py --level 1.0  --pattern alternating
uv run python scripts/probe_residual_authority.py --level 1.0  --pattern noise
```

Compare runs on `zmp_error mean`. Authority is adequate if a full-scale constant
residual shifts it by >= 0.007 m (20% of the ~0.036 m operating error).

### Binning by time since a push

The probe also bins the error by time since the last push, which gives the
recovery profile — how long after a disturbance the tracking error stays
elevated. That is the window a disturbance-gated reward should pay on, so the
sweep sizes `RECOVERY_WINDOW_S` as well as justifying it.

Getting that binning right took two corrections, both of which had inflated the
early bins — the ones that size the window:

- **Detect the push from the term's own record, not the interval timer.**
  `EventManager` re-samples the countdown whenever the term *fires*, including
  the ticks `push_and_record` suppresses during `PUSH_WARMUP_S`. A timer-based
  detector therefore counts pushes that never landed, and with a 10 s warm-up
  that is the first ~2 ticks of every episode. `mdp.steps_since_push` reads
  `last_push_step`, which is only set when a push actually happens.
- **Do not treat an episode reset as a push.** Setting the age to zero on reset
  binned the following 8 s of a *fresh* episode as post-push recovery — and those
  8 s contain the ~4 s posture settle, which carries the largest ZMP errors in
  the run. `steps_since_push` reports a huge age for a push older than the
  current episode, so reset envs drop out of the filter instead.

The gate is `age >= 1`, matching `recovery_tracking`'s: at age 0 the push has
been applied but no physics has run on it yet, so that sample predates its
effect. Matching the gate keeps the bins aligned with the steps the reward is
actually paid on.

See `RECOVERY_TRACKING_WEIGHT` in [reward-shaping.md](reward-shaping.md) for the
profile itself and the caveat that the recorded numbers predate these fixes.

## calibrate_recovery_detector.py

Fits the deployable residual-authority detector from dedicated zero-disturbance
and fixed-energy disturbed cohorts, with even environments used for fitting and
odd environments held out. A failed held-out gate still writes a temporary JSON
when fitting succeeds, but it must not replace
`tasks/residual_balance/recovery_detector.json`.

```sh
uv run python scripts/calibrate_recovery_detector.py \
  --output /tmp/recovery_detector.json --trace-out /tmp/recovery_trace.pt
uv run python scripts/calibrate_recovery_detector.py \
  --output /tmp/recovery_detector.json --trace-in /tmp/recovery_trace.pt
uv run python scripts/verify_live_recovery_detector.py
```

The trace replay is the fast path for filter-only changes. Acceptance requires
nominal mean authority at most 5%, at least 80% recovery samples above 5%
authority in the first 2 s, and fewer than 1% above 5% after 2 s. The live check
then drives nonzero action to assert exact inactive residual zeroing.

## Deterministic contract suites

Every contract this repo asserts without starting a controller lives in
`tests/`, one module per subject, and `uv run pytest` runs all of them in about
12 s. The C++ tests under `src/mc_rtc_interface/tests/` cover the other side of
the boundary; these cover the mjlab side, and the two do not overlap.

| Module | Subject |
| --- | --- |
| `test_native_action_contracts.py` | reference-order scatter and gather, quaternion conversion, sensor routing, dispatch pipeline, `required_controller` |
| `test_residual_mpc_contracts.py` | bridge and blending |
| `test_residual_feedback_contracts.py` | modality widths, parity with ResidualMPC, kick-curriculum gating |
| `test_datastore_inputs.py` | setter shapes, missing configured names, feed-buffer readback, reset persistence |
| `test_balance_curricula.py` | achievement and stratified curricula, rehearsal weights, task registrations |
| `test_effective_training_manifest.py` | checkpoint loading across callable moves, and the negative cases that must still fail |
| `test_evaluation_rollout.py` | reset ordering, observation-history preservation, metric reductions, incomplete episodes, worker truncations, exception cleanup |
| `test_qualification.py` | qualification decisions and strata accounting |
| `test_reward_audit.py` | reward accounting units and weights |
| `test_policy.py` | squashed Gaussian, zero initialization, log-ratio bounds |
| `test_residual_safety.py` | feasibility projection against the `RobotModule`'s bounds |
| `test_watchdog.py` | escalation thresholds and verdicts |

`tests/conftest.py` imports `mjlab` before anything else, because a test module
that reaches this repo's packages first re-enters a half-built
`mc_mjlab.actions` and mjlab swallows the failure as a `[WARN]`.

The evaluation modules test `scripts/evaluation/`, which is on pytest's
`pythonpath` (`[tool.pytest.ini_options]`) and deliberately not in the wheel:
its only callers are the scripts and these tests.

**History:**
- 2026-09-16 -- the surviving checks from `scripts/verify_improvement_contracts.py`
  moved in, grouped by subject. That script was 1430 lines carrying an 18-class
  mjlab mock, and nothing ran it; the migrated checks use real configuration
  classes and small test doubles, and the suite went from 25 cases to 60.
- 2026-09-15 -- moved out of `scripts/` into `tests/`, dropping the three
  `contract_*` ctest entries for the single `python` one. As standalone scripts
  each had its own `main()`, and the two shared contracts ran twice.
- `verify_residual_feedback_contracts.py` asserted a `kick_difficulty`
  curriculum that `e797db2` had already made opt-in, and failed undetected until
  2026-09-14 because nothing ran it.

## sweep_velocity_envelope.py

Maps which velocity commands a ResidualMPC arm can actually track, over a grid
of `--vx`/`--vy`/`--wz` ranges, optionally scoring a checkpoint alongside the
MPC prior. This is the tool behind the ISMPC envelope sections in
[residual-mpc.md](residual-mpc.md); re-run it rather than re-deriving those
numbers by hand.

```sh
uv run python scripts/sweep_velocity_envelope.py --vx 0.0:1.0:6 --num-envs 8
```

**Re-measure if:** the step box, the command ranges or the planner's cruise
speed move.

## verify_residual_mpc_live.py

Runs the paired `lambda=0` / `lambda=0.1` ResidualMPC controller smoke. Distinct
from `verify_native_action_live.py`, which measures zero-residual walking
through both native action modes and says nothing about blending.

```sh
uv run python scripts/verify_residual_mpc_live.py --steps 500
```

## skip_s

**Current:** `--skip-s` discards a leading window of every episode before
scoring. Default `0.0`. It exists to test whether a result depends on the
non-walking startup, and on ResidualMPC it showed that one does.

**The FSM does not walk immediately.** After a controller reset the robot stands:
measured forward speed is `~0` through `4.0 s`, reaches `50%` of settled at
`4.6 s` and `90%` at `5.48 s`, settling at `0.227 m/s`. Every episode pays this,
because `MCGlobalController::reset()` rebuilds the controller.

**It is not a common cost, which is the point.** The reasoning that motivated the
flag was that both arms sit through the same startup, so it only dilutes the
delta. That was wrong. Scoring `std015` `model_999` both ways, same checkpoint,
same `--num-envs 16`, 78/79 episodes against 78/78:

| | unskipped | `--skip-s 5.5` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| baseline `linear_tracking` | 0.04823 | **0.05218** |
| policy `linear_tracking` | 0.05262 | 0.05332 |
| tracking delta | `+9.1%` (p `0.081`) | `+2.2%` (p `0.66`) |
| **TOTAL** | `+5.1%` (p `0.0997`) | **`+3.2%`** (p `0.415`) |

The baseline gains `8.2%` from the skip while the policy gains `1.3%`, so the
policy was beating the prior *inside* the startup window and the delta collapses
when it is removed. The likely mechanism is the residual creeping the robot
forward while the FSM stands, earning tracking reward the prior forgoes.

**Read both numbers.** Unskipped is the task as trained and is what every
recorded ResidualMPC comparison used. Skipped isolates established walking, and
on that measure the residual's advantage is `+3.2%` and not significant. Neither
is wrong; they answer different questions, and quoting only the first overstates
what the policy does once the gait exists.

**Re-measure if:** the FSM's startup changes, or the controller stops being
rebuilt at every reset.

**History:**
- 2026-09-01 — added to test a dilution hypothesis, which it refuted.

## Episodes are not independent samples

**`_welch_p` treats every episode as one sample, and that is wrong here.** The
domain randomization terms — `randomize_friction`, `randomize_pd_gains`,
`randomize_effort` — are all `mode="startup"`, so each environment keeps its own
friction, gains and effort limits for the entire run. Every episode from an
environment shares them. `qualify_checkpoints.py` already clusters by
seed-environment for this reason; `compare_to_baseline.py` does not.

**Measured on `std015` `model_999`, 64 environments, 45 minutes, `--skip-s 5.5`:**

| test | delta | p |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| per-episode Welch, as the script prints it | `-3.9%` | `3.2e-05` |
| clustered: one mean per environment, then Welch | **`-4.2%`** | **`8.7e-03`** |

The printed p is `270x` too small. An intra-class correlation of `0.05-0.08`
predicts a design effect of only `1.4-1.7`, so the discrepancy is larger than
that alone explains: with between-environment sd at about `6%` of the mean, the
environment is a bigger source of variance than the episode.

**The arms do not share their randomization.** `_run_both` splits environments by
index, and each environment's friction and gains are drawn independently, so the
two arms are compared across *different* draws. At `--num-envs 16` — eight per
arm — the standard error on the difference is about `3%` of the mean, which is
the same size as the effects being reported. That is why the same checkpoint
scored `+3.2%` at 16 environments and `-4.2%` at 64.

**Use at least 32 environments per arm and cluster the test.** Everything
recorded before 2026-09-01 used 16 environments total with the per-episode p, and
should be read as indicative at best.

**Re-measure if:** the randomization moves to `mode="reset"`, which would make
episodes within an environment independent and this section obsolete.

**History:**
- 2026-09-01 — found after a 64-environment run reversed the sign of a result
  that four 16-environment runs had reported as positive.

## nominal

**Current:** `--nominal` drops the startup randomization events
(`randomize_friction`, `randomize_pd_gains`, `randomize_effort`,
`encoder_bias`) and zeroes the actuator delay lag, so both arms run the true
model. It is off by default, which is how every comparison before 2026-09-01 was
scored.

**`play=True` does not disable randomization** — it changes only
`console_output`, `print_residual_every` and `num_envs`. So evaluation and the
viewer have always run on randomized friction (`+-10%`), PD gains (`+-5%`),
effort limits (`+-5%`) and a two-step delay lag, with each environment holding
its own draw for the whole run.

**It is not just noise; it carries signal.** `std015` `model_999`, 64
environments, `--skip-s 5.5`, clustered by environment:

| | between-env sd | delta | p |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| randomized | `5.98%` of mean | `-4.21%` | **`0.009`** |
| `--nominal` | `4.31%` | `-1.32%` | `0.181` |

On the true model the residual is indistinguishable from its prior. The
significant deficit appears only under randomization, so the policy handles model
variation worse than the MPC does — which is what one would expect of a prior
that replans against whatever model it is given versus a network fitted to the
centre of a training distribution. Reporting a single randomized number conflates
tracking quality with robustness to model error.

**Randomization is only `28%` of the variance.** Between-environment sd falls
from `5.98%` to `4.31%`, so the remainder is per-environment command draws and
kick samples. Matching those across the two arms — env `i` and env `i + N` given
the same command sequence and the same kick — is the next reduction available,
and a larger one than `--nominal` was.

**Re-measure if:** the randomization ranges change, or the arms are given matched
draws.

**History:**
- 2026-09-01 — added after unmatched randomization was found to be the confound
  behind a result that reversed sign between 16 and 64 environments.

## agent.seed

**Current:** `42` everywhere, including `--nominal` runs, the probes and both
contract suites. Every reported number is therefore one seed, and a policy that
only clears a gate at seed 42 has not been shown to clear it at all.

**`--agent.seed -1` is the lever that randomizes it.** `mjlab/scripts/train.py`
copies `agent.seed` into `env.seed`, and `ManagerBasedRlEnv.__init__` calls its
own `seed()`, whose `-1` branch draws `np.random.randint(0, 10_000)`, seeds
python, numpy, torch and warp from it, and writes the drawn value back into
`cfg.env.seed`. The draw is printed (`Setting seed: N`) and appears in the
startup info table, so the seed behind a run stays recoverable from its log.
`seed=None` is not the same lever: it skips the seeding call entirely. rsl-rl
never reads `agent.seed` itself, so this one call is the whole mechanism.

Use it when a checkpoint looks promising and the question has become whether the
result is the policy or the seed: re-run the screen under two or three drawn
seeds before spending a qualification on it.

**Two hazards.** A run started at `-1` draws a *different* seed when it resumes,
and `seed` is not in `_OPERATIONAL_ENV_KEYS`, so the drawn value sits inside the
training contract and `validate_effective_training_manifest` refuses the resume
on `environment.seed`. Pass the seed the log recorded instead, or move `seed`
into the operational keys if randomized runs should stay resumable. And under
multi-GPU the seed is `agent.seed + rank`, so `-1` randomizes rank 0 only and
hands ranks `1, 2, 3` the fixed seeds `0, 1, 2`.

**Re-measure if:** n/a — structural.
