# Why the numbers are what they are

The measurement record behind this repo's constants and design choices. It lives
here rather than in comments because it is a lab notebook: it matters when you
are *deciding* something, not when you are reading the line that implements it.

| Where | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `README.md` | how to use the repo |
| `AGENTS.md` | how to work in it; hazards you need before touching anything |
| `docs/` (here) | why a specific number or design is what it is |

## Finding a note

Headings **are** the identifier, so the fastest lookup is a grep:

```sh
grep -rn PUSH_VELOCITY docs/
```

The code also carries a link where a note exists, sharing the one comment line
with the terse reason:

```python
# Difficulty dial; the baseline should almost always fail. docs/difficulty.md#push-velocity
PUSH_VELOCITY = 0.4
```

Grep is the primary route and the link is the convenience, deliberately: a link
can rot, a heading that is the identifier cannot go missing without the note
itself going missing.

Which is why the link is **skipped where the heading is already the function's
own name** — `grep` finds `dcm_stability` from the code either way, and the
comment budget is better spent where the connection is not guessable.

## Writing a note

One `##` section per identifier, three fixed fields, so an update appends a
bullet instead of rewriting a paragraph:

```markdown
## SOME_CONSTANT

**Current:** `0.4` — one sentence on what it buys.

**Re-measure if:** what would invalidate the number.

**History:**
- 2026-07-31 — what was run, what it showed.
```

Keep the measurements verbatim when moving them. The numbers are the asset; a
paraphrase that drops the sample size is worth much less than the original.

`scripts/check_prose.py` enforces the other half of the arrangement — that
the code stays under 10% prose with one-line docstrings — and reports headings
here whose identifier or file no longer exists, across Python and C++ alike. The
edit-time hook stays advisory; `--strict` turns those reports into failures and
is what pre-commit runs, so a rename cannot quietly orphan a note.

A heading is therefore the identifier **only while the identifier is live**. A
section that outlives its code keeps its measurements verbatim and takes a
descriptive heading — `Retired: <name>` for something this repo removed, plain
prose for a narrative section that never named code. Both stay greppable by
name and neither is reported as stale.
