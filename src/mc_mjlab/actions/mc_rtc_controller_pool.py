"""Main-side transport for the per-env mc_rtc controllers.

Owns the worker processes (or the single in-process ``ControllerHost``), their
pipes and the two shared-memory I/O blocks, and exposes a small dispatch API to
the action term:

    pool = ControllerPool(...)      # spawns workers (non-blocking)
    metadata = pool.await_ready()   # block until controllers are constructed
    pool.configure(layout)          # allocate shm, hand the layout to the hosts
    pool.reset_envs(indices)        # synchronous controller reset
    pool.dispatch_controller_step(indices)     # async controller step (worker path)
    idx = pool.collect()            # await the outstanding step

``in_np``/``out_np`` are the shared input/output arrays (available after
``configure``); the action writes inputs and reads outputs directly on the hot
path. Torch- and mjlab-free, like the worker-side ``ControllerHost``.

  A worker that dies or goes unresponsive mid-run (mc_rtc can wedge inside
